### How to Contribute

1. Make sure you're working on a feature branch. I won't accept pull requests to `master`. The naming convention is `<initials>-<branch-name>`. For example, `az-update-readme`.

2. Once you `git commit` your changes, rebase onto latest master to avoid conflicts. (`git checkout master`, `git pull origin master`, `git checkout <my-branch>`, `git rebase master`)

3. `git push` your branch and create a Pull Request. If feedback is given, update your branch and force push to it.

4. Once the PR is merged, feel free to delete your local branch if desired.
